# Customer-Segmention using Machine Learning

📌 Overview

This project applies K-Means Clustering and DBSCAN for customer segmentation. It helps businesses group customers based on purchasing behaviors to improve marketing strategies.

🚀 Features

Clustering Techniques: K-Means, DBSCAN, and (optional) Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM)

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and dimensionality reduction

3D Visualization: Interactive customer segmentation using Plotly

Evaluation Metrics: Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index

Future Enhancements: Deep Learning-based clustering, real-time customer profiling

🔧 Tech Stack

Python

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

Jupyter Notebook

📂 Dataset
